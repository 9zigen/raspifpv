RaspiFPV: FPV (First Person View) tools for Raspberry Pi
========================================================

This software implements a Raspberry Pi-based VTX/RTX+OSD facility for FPV (First Person View).

'raspifpvtx' creates and runs a GStreamer pipeline to receive video from the Raspicam, compress using the Raspi's H264 hardware encoder and broadcast over UDP. It also receives various inputs from voltage/current sensors via the MCP3008 ADC, and GPS information over a serial line from the NAZA GPS.

'raspifpvrx' creates and runs a GGtreamer pipeline to receive and display video received over UDP. It also receives telemetry from the airframe and displays an OSD (On Screen Display).

Airframe Usage:

    raspifpvtx [options]

Ground Station Usage:

    raspifpvrx [options]
